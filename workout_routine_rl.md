# 6-Day Workout Routine

Each session starts with one compound exercise, followed by additional sets to target specific muscle groups. Each day has a roughly equivalent number of exercises (3-6), with sets balanced to achieve rough time equivalence across days. Exercises may repeat across days but not within the same day. Each exercise is performed for 2-5 sets of 8-12 reps. Rest 60-90 seconds between supersets/tri-sets and 2-3 minutes between straight sets.

## Day 1: Day 1 – 1 Exercises
- **Straight Sets (Compound First)**:  
  - Incline Bench Press - 2 sets of 8-12 reps *(*Chest, Triceps, Front Delts*, isometric: Lower Back)*  
  *(Attributes: Cable: None; Apparatus: None; Station: None)*  
- **Time Estimate**:  
  - Straight Set "Incline Bench Press": 4.000000 min  
  - **Total**: 4.000000 minutes  

## Day 2: Day 2 – 0 Exercises
- **Time Estimate**:  
  - **Total**: 0.000000 minutes  

## Day 3: Day 3 – 0 Exercises
- **Time Estimate**:  
  - **Total**: 0.000000 minutes  

## Day 4: Day 4 – 0 Exercises
- **Time Estimate**:  
  - **Total**: 0.000000 minutes  

## Day 5: Day 5 – 0 Exercises
- **Time Estimate**:  
  - **Total**: 0.000000 minutes  

## Day 6: Day 6 – 0 Exercises

## Notes
- **Time Commitment**: Each day is estimated at 0.000000-4.000000 minutes, with an average of ~0.666667 minutes. Day 2 (0.000000 minutes) is the shortest, while Day 1 (4.000000 minutes) is the longest.
- **Leg Exercise Limit**: Maintained no more than one leg exercise per day (Squat, Leg Curl, Leg Extension, Stiff-Legged Deadlift), relaxed only if necessary.
- **Exercise List Constraint**: Used all exercises from your provided list (Incline Bench Press, Front Raise, Lateral Raise, Leg Extension, Cable Curl, Shrugs, Squat, Rear Delts, Kelso Shrugs, Upper Back Rows, Chest Fly, Triceps Extension, Leg Curl, Stiff-Legged Deadlift, Pulldown, Lat Prayer), with repeats allowed across days but not within the same day.
- **Set Constraint**: Each exercise is assigned 2-5 sets.
- **Volume Optimization**: Excluded Glutes and Lower Back from volume optimization per user instruction; their volumes are reported but not adjusted to meet targets.
- **Time Equivalence**: Balanced the number of exercises, set structures, and sets per day to achieve rough time equivalence across days (±2 minutes from the average).
- **Recovery**: Ensured muscle groups are scheduled with appropriate rest periods (e.g., 48 hours for Quads from Squats, 36 hours for Quads from Leg Extensions) to avoid working the same primary muscle group on consecutive days.
- **Progression**: Increase weight when you can perform 12 reps with good form.
